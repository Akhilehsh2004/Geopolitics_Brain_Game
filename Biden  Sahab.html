            US President Joe Biden revealed on Monday that he is nearing the completion of a final proposal aimed at securing the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to Reuters. Speaking at the White House, Biden expressed his dissatisfaction with
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to advance the agreement, stating bluntly that he does not believe Netanyahu is doing enough.Biden’s comments followed the recent recovery of six hostages' bodies by Israeli forces from a
            tunnel in Gaza. Among the deceased is Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American-Israeli. The hostages were reportedly killed by Hamas militants shortly before being discovered. The discovery of the hostages’ bodies has intensified criticism
            of the Biden administration's approach to the Gaza ceasefire and has increased domestic pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of the remaining captives.When asked if Netanyahu was adequately addressing the situation, Biden responded
            simply, "No," without providing further details. He did indicate, however, that a final proposal for the hostage deal could be presented to both sides within the week, adding, "We're very close to that." Regarding the proposal's potential
            success, he remained optimistic, saying, "Hope springs eternal."Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were slated to meet with the US hostage deal negotiating team, on Monday, to discuss efforts toward an agreement for the release of the
            remaining captives. Meanwhile, Israeli protesters took to the streets for a second consecutive day on Monday, and the country's largest trade union, Histadrut, initiated a general strike to pressure the government into securing a deal for
            the return of hostages still held by Hamas. The discovery of six additional captives' bodies in Gaza intensified the unrest. The strike led to significant disruptions in transport and medical services across various Israeli districts, with
            numerous shops and businesses closing their doors following Histadrut's call for the general stoppage.
