            Last week, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment accusing a Tennessee-based company, believed to be Tenet Media, of accepting millions of dollars from the Russian state-owned media outlet RT and promoting “pro-Russia propaganda
            and disinformation across social media to US audiences”. Tenet was responsible for high-profile right-wing influencers, including Dave Rubin, Lauren Southern and Tim Pool. “Ukraine is the enemy of this country,” Pool angrily declared on his
            YouTube blog in August to his 1.3 million subscribers. “Ukraine is our enemy, being funded by the Democrats … Ukraine is the greatest threat to this nation and to the world. We should rescind all funding and financing, pull out all military
            support, and we should apologise to Russia.” Although politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties have approved defence spending for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia, a vocal Republican faction centred around presidential
            candidate Donald Trump is calling to either scale down or halt aid entirely, which would advantage Russia in the conflict. Pool, along with Rubin and others, denied being a willing accomplice. “Never at any point did anyone other than I have
            full editorial control of the show and the contents of the show are often apolitical,” he wrote on X on September 5. As well as federal indictments, the US Treasury slapped RT, whose employees are accused of funnelling cash to Tenet, with
            sanctions. Separately, the Russian-born former Trump adviser and conservative pundit, Dimitri Simes, was indicted for allegedly working on behalf of another sanctioned Russian broadcaster, Channel One. In Russia, news of the sanctions and
            indictments were framed as another front of informational warfare.Russian TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, centre, talks to service members before a ceremony inaugurating Vladimir Putin as president of Russia at the Kremlin in Moscow, May 7,
            2024 [Sergei Savostyanov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters] “Dimitri Simes is not just a political scientist, but someone who frequently and personally communicated with Trump, as well as his team,” TV host Vladimir Solovyov explained on his talk show.
            “They’ll say that through Simes, Trump is a Russian agent and this proves that how the Russians, through Simes, are attempting to influence Trump … I believe they’re mounting another line of attack against Donald Trump by charging Dimitri
            Simes.” Solovyov said Moscow should offer asylum to those indicted for conspiring with Russian state media. As Putin said, he added, “we don’t extradite freedom fighters”, referring to the Russian president’s statement on providing a safe
            harbour to American whistleblower Edward Snowden. “I’m waiting for when they try to drag in Tucker Carlson,” said Solovyov, of the US conservative pundit who interviewed Putin in February in Russia. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a close Putin
            ally, praised RT’s chief editor Margarita Simonyan.
