            President Joe Biden says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to reach a deal to free hostages and reach a cease-fire in its war with Hamas in Gaza. Biden spoke to reporters Monday, two days after six hostages, including one Israeli-American,
            were found after being killed by Hamas. Protests rocked Israel over the government’s handling of the negotiations. Asked if Netanyahu was doing enough, Biden responded, “No.”Biden was arriving at the White House for a Situation Room meeting
            with advisers involved in negotiating a hostage deal and cease-fire. He insisted that negotiators remain “very close” to a deal, adding, “Hope springs eternal.” THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. A rare call
            for a general strike in Israel to protest the failure to return hostages held in Gaza led to closures and other disruptions around the country on Monday, including at its main international airport. But it was ignored in some areas, reflecting
            deep political divisions.Hundreds of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets late Sunday in grief and anger after six hostages were found dead in Gaza. The families and much of the public blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying
            they could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas to end the nearly 11-month-old war.
