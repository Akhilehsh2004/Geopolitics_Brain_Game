            Oleksandr Syrskii, Ukraine’s top military commander, has defended Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, saying the offensive was working because Russia had not advanced on a key area of the eastern front in Ukraine for six days. Kyiv launched
            its surprise offensive into Kursk on August 6 and says it has captured an estimated 1,300 square kilometres (502sq miles) of territory and dozens of settlements. Officials have said the offensive was part of a strategy to slow Russia’s advance
            towards the strategically important town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Speaking to United States broadcast network, CNN, Syrskii said Ukraine was doing “everything possible not to lose Pokrovsk”. “Over the past six days, the enemy
            hasn’t advanced a single metre in the Pokrovsk direction,” he said. “In other words, our strategy is working.” It was not possible to verify the situation on the front line and the claims made by each side. Earlier on Thursday, Russian President
            Vladimir Putin said the Kursk offensive had failed to slow Russia’s advance and that the move had only served to weaken Ukraine’s defences in Donetsk. Analysts say Russia has moved few soldiers from the Ukrainian east to Kursk, where its forces
            are supported by conscripts and ethnic Chechen fighters. Amid the continued fighting and a new wave of Russian bombardment that has killed dozens over the past week, Ukraine has stepped up pressure on the US and its other allies to provide
            it with more air defences and allow it to use Western-supplied long-range weapons on military targets inside Russia. Those issues are likely to be discussed later on Friday when members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), a group
            that provides military aid to Ukraine, meet in Germany. Ahead of the meeting, the United Kingdom announced it would supply 650 lightweight multirole missile (LMM) systems to boost Ukraine’s air defence capabilities with the first deliveries
            by the end of the year. “In recent days, we have seen the tragic cost of Russia’s indiscriminate strikes on Poltava and Lviv,” UK Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement. “These new UK-made missiles will support Ukraine to defend
            its people, infrastructure and territory from Putin’s brutal attacks.”
