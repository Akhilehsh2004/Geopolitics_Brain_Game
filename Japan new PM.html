            Japan's leadership race kicked off on Thursday (Sep 12) with a record nine candidates including the surfing son of a former prime minister and an arch-nationalist vying to be the first woman premier. Whoever wins the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership
            contest on Sep 27 will succeed unpopular Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose three-year term was tarnished by scandals and unease over rising prices.The contest comes as Japan beefs up defence spending and cooperation with fellow US allies
            to counter China and as the spluttering world-number-four economy struggles with a slow-burn demographic crisis. The conservative LDP has governed almost uninterrupted for decades and holds a majority in parliament, meaning the winner is essentially
            guaranteed to become premier.Leading the polls are Shinjiro Koizumi, 43, a former environment minister and the son of ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi, and veteran former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, 67. "I want to change the politics of Japan,
            left behind by the changing times," Koizumi said as the candidates each made a campaign speech at the LDP headquarters. His pledges include labour market deregulation, making political funds more transparent, and to "settle issues that have
            been debated for years" such as allowing married couples to have separate surnames. Meanwhile Ishiba, highlighting regional tensions, referred to North Korea's ballistic missile test on Thursday morning. "They are not doing this as a joke,"
            he said, arguing of the need to build an organisation like NATO in East Asia.
