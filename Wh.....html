            Japan won wheelchair rugby gold, completing an undefeated five-game streak at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, in a 48-41 final against Team USA on Monday (2 September). The packed Champ-de-Mars Arena saw a full range of emotions from the fans who smiled,
            cried, stomped the scaffolding stands, and applauded the tense match as both teams left it all on the court on the biggest stage in wheelchair rugby competition. Japan came into the final as the undefeated favourites having previously defeated
            Team USA 45-42 in pool play. Top scorers securing the gold for Japan were stalwart Ike Yukinobu with 16, rising star Hashimoto Katsuya with 19, and legend Ikezaki Daisuke contributing six. The gold medal match started off strong with for Team
            USA leading by three points 14-11 after the first quarter. The second quarter saw Japan pick up the pace with a four-point swing to finish 24-23 ahead at half-time. Japan amped up their lead in the third quarter as the USA side ran out of
            timeouts, putting the team at a disadvantage and also starting a worrying turnover trend, finishing with Japan leading 35-32. The fourth quarter was no better for Team USA as the turnover count climbed to nine and Japan locked into a rhythm,
            extending its lead 48-41 to win gold. Japan won bronze at Tokyo 2020 and Rio 2016, while Team USA were the Tokyo 2020 and Rio 2016 silver medallists. The top scorers for Team USA were Chuck Aoki and Sarah Adam, both with 14, while Josh Wheeler
            contributed seven. Adam, the first female player to compete on the USA wheelchair rugby team at a Paralympic Games, proved to be a clutch player in Paris. This silver medal finish also makes Aoki the most decorated wheelchair rugby player
            in U.S. history, with three silvers and a bronze. The London 2012 and Rio 2016 champions, Australia, beat out Great Britain 50-48 in an earlier match to claim the bronze medal.
